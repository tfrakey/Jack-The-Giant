# Jack-The-Giant
In this game you are a giant who is descending down a giant beanstalk through the clouds, picking up gold coins along the way. But beware, dark clouds are dangerous and one misstep could spell doom! You get 3 lives to travel down as far as you can and collect as many coins as you can. The game keeps track of your highscore on all three difficulty levels.
